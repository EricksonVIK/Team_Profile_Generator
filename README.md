  ## Description 
 The application was created to generate a team roster in HTML format for display.  

 Team Profile Generate is a command-line application that captures user input via inquirer. Utilizes the responses to generate html block specific to Manager, Engineer, and Intern.  The created block is then inserted into the skeletal structure of the html and index.html is returned to the .dist folder within the structure.

 Tests are provided within the __test__ folder.
